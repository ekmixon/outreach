JSTOR is a digital library for the intellectually curious. We provide a platform for discovering and 
connecting research, images, and primary sources. As a not-for-profit, we partner with libraries, 
museums, and publishers to reduce costs, extend access, and preserve scholarship for the future.

We are also continuously working to expand the diversity of content on JSTOR, most recently by 
providing a freely accessible venue for libraries’ special collections to reach researchers, faculty, and 
students across the world.  We do this because we believe in the power of knowledge to change the 
world for the better.
